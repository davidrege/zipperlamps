zipperlamps
===========

Rhino python script that can create multi piece closed volumes from singly curved surfaces

USE
Create a Rhino model with surfaces describing your shape on a layer called "base" and edge curves describing the edges you'd like to zipper on a layer called "edges".

Run the script to create edge curves that can be exported and used with a lasercutter, vinyl cutter or similar digital fab machine.
